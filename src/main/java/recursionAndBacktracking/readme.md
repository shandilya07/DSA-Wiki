# Recursion
## Basics of Recursion
* Recursion is a way of code implementation in which a method calls itself again and again
* Since you can't have the recursion happening forever, you need to have a base case. This is a condition where the recursion stops
* Stack Space is the memory where the recursive call state is maintained. It is cleared off when the recursive call gets completed for that round
* Recursion tree is a way of representing a recursive call
